Dustin Riley
## Description
This project will be using the packages NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas in order to create dataframes. This isn't intended to be full blown data science project. The goal here is to come up with some question and then see what API or datasets you can use to get the information needed to answer that question
## Pip install instructions
Please run the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Go to https://api.data.gov/signup/ and signup for an API key.
Then create a config.py file and add it to .gitignore.

Inside config.py:
```
key = "Your API key here"
```
